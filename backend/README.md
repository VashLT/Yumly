## Install guide
Yo here's a story about a little ```console``` that lives in a ```solarized dark``` world and all day and all night and everything he sees is just ```NullPointerException``` like him inside and outside.

```NullPointerException``` his terminal with a blue little Windows and a blue screen and everything is blue for him and himself and everybody around cause he is running windows.

With this small introduction let's start.

Per the previous text I reccomend using Linux (I'm using Ubuntu), just create a virtual enviroment with:

```python3 -m venv env```

Now activate it, on Linux you can use this:

```source ./env/bin/activate```

On windows you might get away with:

```./env/bin/activate.ps1```

Finally run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` and you're done.
